# WITH's Coding Guidelines

## Introduction

As you are part of WITH, you are not an individual developer but rather you take
your place in a team that works together in numerous ways. Because no one is
perfect, no project is ever finished and no requirement is set in stone, we
ought to work in a way that acknowledges the reality of our mission. The present
document explores the techniques to get as close as possible to this goal.

```{warning}
This document will hurt your feelings. But the main rule is: no exceptions.
If you think that 2 spaces is inherently better than using 4 spaces, you can
do it whichever way you want on your personal projects but here you must think
of what happens when you're sick and that someone must jump into your project
at the last minute without any prepartion. Your job is complicated as it is,
let's focus your brain power on writing code and not on personal style.
```

```{note}
That said, this document is hosted in Git. If you feel like the rules should
change don't hesitate to talk about it and to submit a pull request!
